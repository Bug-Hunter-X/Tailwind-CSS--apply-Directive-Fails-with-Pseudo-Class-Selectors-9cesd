This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-class selector (like `:hover`, `:focus`, etc.).  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle these selectors and can lead to unexpected styling or no styling at all.

Example:
```css
/* styles.css */
.btn-primary {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
  @apply hover:bg-blue-700;
}
```

In this scenario, the `hover:bg-blue-700` part might not work as expected, leading to a missing hover effect.
